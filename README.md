# Global-Terrorism-Database

One of my Academic project I worked on. The project includes five-sheet design methodology that has been adapted in creating the visualization in the R Shiny Web application.

## Overview of the GTD
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017 (with additional annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 cases. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and--when identifiable--the group or individual responsible.

## Wrangling Data
The repository contains the dataset (*.csv*) with only the required variables. The raw dataset from Global Terrorism Database contains
more than 200+ variables, aggregation and cleaning was performed on python and some aggregation was performed in the R code itself. If you have any questions, please post I will be happy to help!!
